# Isoform Comparison Dashboard (WIP 🚧)

This project is a **Streamlit-based web app** designed to help researchers explore and compare isoforms from long-read transcriptome analysis tools such as FLAIR, IsoQuant, and TALON.

> ⚠️ This app is currently under development. Some features and results may not be final.

---

## 📌 Planned Features

- Upload and compare GTF files from multiple tools
- Match transcripts to reference annotations
- Classify isoforms as **Novel**, **Annotated Variants**, or **Consensus**
- Visualize exon structures and structural differences
- Filter by gene, tool, or transcript ID
- Export summary tables

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Streamlit 📊
- Pandas, NumPy
- Custom exon comparison logic
